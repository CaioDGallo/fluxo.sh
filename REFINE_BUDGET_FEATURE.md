I want to refine the budgets feature. The way I want it to behave is as follows: It must be possible to set a "total amount of budget for the month". We will still have the per category budget amount as we do today, but I want it so that each categoy we set a budget it "removes" visually some budget from this total amount. While creating and setting the budget, it must be possible to see how many of this total budget is left to be distributed through the categories. We should display a message of some kind "R$356 left from the R$5000 budget" and a bar pattern similar to what we have for category budget today.
